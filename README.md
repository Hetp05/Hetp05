# 👋 Hi, I'm **Het PATEL** 👨‍💻

I’m an 18-year-old high school student based in **Paris**, passionate about technology, design, and creativity.

I’m currently exploring **web design engineering**, aiming to build a career in the **fintech industry** (yes, a bit specific 😅) — but I’m also open to going with the flow as technology evolves.

Right now, I can build websites using **HTML** and **CSS**, and I’m learning **frontend development** with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

When I’m not working on web projects, I love making **simple indie games** using **GDscript** in **Godot Engine**. I also enjoy creating **pixel art** in **Aseprite** and composing **game soundtracks** in **FL Studio**.
